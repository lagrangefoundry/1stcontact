## Scope

> ⚠️ **Model update (2026-06-30):** this ticket predates [[DOC-12]] (Site Storage, Versioning & Rendering Model) and must be reconciled before implementation: (1) **drop **`published_revision_id` — the model is forward-only, so the live site is always the latest revision (derivable, no pointer); (2) **revisions must snapshot the entire site** (definition + assets + metadata), not the `definition` column alone — assets are versioned in R2 with the revision; (3) **adopt per-page granularity** (a `pages` table, per [[DOC-5]]) rather than single `draft_definition`/`published_definition` JSON blobs. The schemas below are the pre-reconciliation draft.

D1 schema for the multi-site, draft/published, revision-tracked data model. Accounts, sites, revisions, and the foreign-key bones to support per-account multi-site even though v1 UX exposes only the single-site path.

After this REQ: `sites` table holds one row per site with separate `draft_definition` and `published_definition` JSON columns; `revisions` table holds a snapshot per publish event; `accounts` table carries the operator identity + plan_tier needed to gate system actions. Migrations are reversible and locally testable.

Design discussion: see [[DOC-5]] (forthcoming amendment: site-definition lifecycle, accounts/sites/revisions schema) and CHAT-9 — draft/publish lifecycle leans confirmed (per-publish revisions; published is what the build renders; draft is what the builder edits).

## Why free-coded

Schema-only REQ — single cohesive intent. The shape is settled by the lifecycle decisions in CHAT-9. No algorithmic design; just translating decisions into SQL migrations + types.

## Dependencies

None. Foundational for REQ-11 (source project) (API lifecycle) and REQ-12 (source project) (UI lifecycle). Concurrent with REQ-9 (source project) (API foundation); no ordering required between them.

## Deliverables

### D1 migrations (`db/migrations/`)

Sequential numbered migrations:

`002_accounts.sql`

```
CREATE TABLE accounts (
  id            TEXT PRIMARY KEY,           -- UUID
  email         TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  display_name  TEXT,
  plan_tier     TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'trial', -- 'trial' | 'paid'
  created_at    INTEGER NOT NULL,           -- unix millis
  updated_at    INTEGER NOT NULL
);

```

`003_sites.sql`

```
CREATE TABLE sites (
  id                     TEXT PRIMARY KEY,    -- UUID
  account_id             TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES accounts(id),
  slug                   TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, -- global namespace within *.1stcontact.io
  display_name           TEXT NOT NULL,
  draft_definition       TEXT NOT NULL,        -- JSON site definition (working state)
  published_definition   TEXT,                  -- JSON site definition (live), NULL if never published
  published_at           INTEGER,               -- unix millis of most recent publish
  published_revision_id  TEXT,                  -- FK to revisions.id of currently-live snapshot
  created_at             INTEGER NOT NULL,
  updated_at             INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE INDEX idx_sites_account_id ON sites(account_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_sites_slug ON sites(slug);

```

`004_revisions.sql`

```
CREATE TABLE revisions (
  id              TEXT PRIMARY KEY,           -- UUID
  site_id         TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES sites(id),
  definition      TEXT NOT NULL,              -- JSON snapshot of the published definition
  published_at    INTEGER NOT NULL,
  published_by    TEXT,                       -- account_id of the publisher
  description     TEXT,                       -- optional operator-supplied note
  created_at      INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE INDEX idx_revisions_site_id ON revisions(site_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_revisions_site_id_published_at ON revisions(site_id, published_at DESC);

```

### Reserved slug list

A static list in code (`packages/site-schema/src/reserved-slugs.ts`) of slugs that cannot be claimed by operators:

```
api, app, www, admin, preview, ftp, mail, blog,
status, dashboard, control, docs, help, support,
1stcontact, gendev, gendevlabs

```

The `INSERT` for the 1st Contact marketing site (existing `sites/1stcontact/site.json`) uses slug `1stcontact` from this reserved list — operator-owned, not user-allocatable.

### Slug validation

`packages/site-schema/src/slug.ts`:

```
function isValidSlug(s: string): boolean
function isReservedSlug(s: string): boolean
function suggestAlternativeSlug(taken: string): string[]

```

- Valid slug: 3–40 chars, lowercase ASCII + digits + hyphens, no leading/trailing hyphen, no consecutive hyphens.

- Suggestions on collision: `<slug>-<short-hash>`, `<slug>-co`, `<slug>-app`, etc.

### Seed data

A one-time seed migration `005_seed_1stcontact.sql` that inserts the platform-owned account and the 1st Contact site row, pointing `draft_definition` and `published_definition` at the contents of `sites/1stcontact/site.json` from the repo. The marketing site is an ordinary site — this seed is simply the first instance of the general pattern: a site authored file-backed in `sites/<name>/` is migrated into D1, which is its canonical home. File-backed is a development/seed representation, not a separate permanent path.

### Types

`packages/site-schema/src/db-types.ts` — TypeScript types matching each table row, plus `SiteRecord`, `AccountRecord`, `RevisionRecord` with parsed-JSON variants.

## UATs (`test_UAT_FC_<REQ-ID>_*`)

- `migrations_apply_clean` — fresh D1, apply all migrations including seed; tables exist, indexes exist, seed row present.

- `migrations_reversible` — each migration has a `DROP` counterpart that leaves the schema empty.

- `slug_validation_accepts_valid` — `acme`, `my-bakery`, `a-1-b` accepted.

- `slug_validation_rejects_invalid` — empty, too short, too long, uppercase, special chars, consecutive hyphens, leading/trailing hyphen, all rejected.

- `slug_validation_rejects_reserved` — `api`, `www`, `admin`, `preview`, `1stcontact` rejected as reserved.

- `slug_collision_suggestions_non_empty` — `suggestAlternativeSlug('taken')` returns at least three candidates not equal to the input.

- `unique_constraint_on_slug` — inserting two sites with the same slug fails with a unique-constraint violation.

- `seed_1stcontact_loads_real_definition` — the seeded `1stcontact` site's `draft_definition` parses to a valid Site per the `@1stcontact/site-schema` validator from REQ-3.

## Out of scope

- Magic-link / sessions tables — separate auth REQ.

- Custom-domain mappings — later REQ (paid feature).

- Asset records (R2 refs) — already partly covered in REQ-3's `AssetRef` type; binary storage and full asset CRUD comes with a later REQ.

- Audit log table — later, alongside system-action audit.

- Soft-delete columns — later if needed; v1 sites are not deletable.

## Risks / open items

- **JSON column size** — D1 SQLite TEXT columns hold large JSON fine; site definitions are typically well under 1MB. Add a guard in API REQs that rejects definitions exceeding 5MB pre-persist.

- **Slug-uniqueness race** — `INSERT` race on slug uniqueness is handled by the UNIQUE constraint at the DB level. API REQs catch the constraint violation and return a 409 with suggestions.

- **Bootstrap path** — the 1st Contact site is authored file-backed (`sites/1stcontact/site.json`) as a seed fixture. This REQ's seed migration loads it into D1, its canonical home — the same file→D1 migration every site follows. `tools/generate` reads file-backed seeds today and should be updated by a later REQ to read from D1 when available; once it does, filespace is purely an authoring/seed convenience.

## Coordination note from REQ-20 (source project) (added 2026-06-18)

REQ-20 (source project) (web fetch safety + R2 assets) is landing **before** this REQ and needs an `account_id` for its per-account rate-limit and Browser Rendering budget counters. Because the `accounts` table does not yet exist, REQ-20 (source project) extracts `account_id` from the `x-account-id` request header with a `"default"` fallback, behind a single function (`extractAccountId(request, env)`) in `apps/control-app/src/safety/account.ts`.

**Action for REQ-7:** when implementing the accounts schema and the auth path that issues `account_id`, update `extractAccountId` (or replace the call site) to resolve `account_id` from the authenticated session / magic-link cookie instead of the header. The function signature is the only contract REQ-20 (source project) depends on — replacing the body is sufficient; no shape change in the KV counter keys is required.

KV counters in `FETCH_RATE_KV` and `BROWSER_BUDGET_KV` are keyed by `account_id`. Switching from `"default"` to real account IDs migrates cleanly (existing default-keyed counters become orphaned and age out via TTL).

## Implementation note (2026-06-20, commit 8ea7a82)

Landed as specified above. Notes for downstream REQs:

- **Migration numbering follows the existing 4-digit convention** (`0002_*`–`0005_*`) rather than the 3-digit numbering shown in the original ticket, to match `0001_create_leads.sql`. Lexicographic ordering is preserved.

- **Down migrations live in **`db/migrations-down/` (sibling directory), one `.down.sql` per forward migration. They are NOT in `db/migrations/` because `wrangler d1 migrations` scans that directory and would treat down files as forward migrations. The `migrations_reversible` UAT applies them via the test helper.

- **Seed IDs are deterministic, not UUIDs**: `acct_1stcontact_platform`, `site_1stcontact`, `rev_1stcontact_seed`. Recognisable as platform-owned and stable across rebuilds. Customer accounts will use UUIDs.

- **Seed JSON embedded inline** in `0005_seed_1stcontact.sql` as a SQL string literal (single quotes doubled per SQLite). The seed is a frozen snapshot of `sites/1stcontact/site.json` at commit time; future drift is expected (a later REQ should update `tools/generate` to read from D1).

- `extractAccountId`** left header-driven**: per the coordination note, the swap to session-cookie resolution belongs to the auth REQ. This REQ is schema-only.

- `SITES_DB`** binding name** used in the test helper; wrangler.toml currently binds `LEADS_DB`. The API REQ (REQ-11 (source project)) will add the new D1 binding to wrangler.toml — this REQ does not modify wrangler config.

UATs (8 files, 53 tests) all pass. The two failing tests in the broader suite (REQ-30 (source project) and BUG-5 doc-drift guards) are pre-existing on `main` and unrelated.

## Model note (2026-07-01)

> Per [[DOC-14]], the D1 model must also: store **site-local / draft modules** (bespoke-module artifacts) and **gate publish on module hardening** (a site cannot publish while depending on an unhardened bespoke module). Fold into this ticket's reconciliation before implementation.
