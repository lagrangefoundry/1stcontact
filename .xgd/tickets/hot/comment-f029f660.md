#### You
Part of our contract to the user has to be that their site is guaranteed to be working. That means not just that the webpages are accessible, but that the email is delivering and receiving and the web forms are working, including payments. To this and one of our important requirements is basic flow monitoring (BFM). This epic is related to epic eight. Epic eight is the front end and visibility to the user it will contain things like Google analytics and possibly SEO/SEM statistics things like that. This ticket is the technical implementation of the site functional tests that will be running continuously. We can discuss the use of the parties such as ping but I'm not sure if those are really going to help us that much.

One of the court goals here is to design test guttering into the product from the outset (now) so that testing doesn't become an ad on later. Examples of guttering are that we want to test the white paper sign-up flow. However, we want to do it in a way that the system recognizes the traffic as test traffic and does not add it to the Contacts page, list it in the matrix etc.

Please read the chat entitled "Email receipt" - transcript is in a comment

BFM needs to be thought of as:
- platform tests - we can have a small set of example sites that demonstrate all the features of the platform
- per business tests - fewer, less frequent 
- continuous monitoring and to be run after a deployment

In that chat session I did talk about tracing email all the way to a thirdparty inbox, but that might be overkill we will have fairly sophisticated email routing capabilities it may be enough to send the email out into the world and have it come back into our system.

For these tests we will clearly need a cloud setup - maybe it should be - or some of it should be outside of Cloudflare - for obvious outage reasons
